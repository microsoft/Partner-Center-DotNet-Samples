# Partner Center SDK for .NET Samples

## Overview

Console application that demonstrates each scenario the Partner Center SDK for .NET is capable of performing.

## Getting Started

Before you build the application, update the values in the *App.config* file to reflect the Azure AD authentication information you created in [Partner Center authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/partner-center/develop/partner-center-authentication). Specifically, you should use your integration sandbox account settings during early development or for testing in production.

Under **ScenarioSettings** in the *App.config* file, you can set parameters that will be automatically passed into the scenarios that you run.

To modify the list of scenarios that are run, comment out lines in **MainScenarios** or in an individual **Get Scenarios** method found in the *Program.cs* file.

## Prerequisites

With previous versions of this sample there were configurations for user credentials. Those configurations have been removed, and now you will be prompted to enter the credentials upon execution. This change was made due to the upcoming requirement to use multi-factor authentication (MFA) when access Partner Center and the Partner Center API using app + user authentication. Please note that the approach used by this application to obtain user credentials is just one way this operation can be performed. It is recommended that you review the [Secure App Model](../secure-app-model/README.md) sample for more information.

### Azure Active Directory

Perform the following task to correctly configure the Azure AD application for use with this sample project.

1. Sign in to the [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/cloud-solution-provider/csp-partner) using credentials that have *Admin Agent* and *Global Admin* privileges
2. Click on _Dashboard_  at the top of the page, then click on the cog icon in the upper right, and then click the _Partner settings_.
3. Add a new native application if one does not exist already.
4. Sign in to the [Azure management portal](https://portal.azure.com) using the same credentials from step 1.
5. Click on the _Azure Active Directory_ icon in the toolbar.
6. Click _App registrations_ -> Select _All apps_ from the drop down -> Click on the application created in step 3.
7. Click _Authentication_ from left menu blade and then click _Add Platform_
8. In the Right popup blade, Click on _Mobile and Desktop Applications_
8. Select **https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/nativeclient** as one of the available Redirect URIs ( You need to add a custom redirectUri too. Add **http://localhost** but we will be using the one added earlier ).
9. Click _Configure_. Your set of redirect Uris will be added under Platform **Mobile and Desktop Applications**.
10. Be sure to click the _Save_ button to ensure the changes are saved.
